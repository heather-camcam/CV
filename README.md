Flying the flag for developers who care as much about the customer experience as the code beneath the hood, I have a healthy obsession for customer-centric design and building accessible products, likely inherited from my former role as Product Manager.

I've contributed to the design, build and launch of products at a commercial level whilst Product Manager at leading mobile agency as well as when part of a winning Hackathon team at the [Decoded Fashion Hackathon](http://blog.decodedfashion.com/stories/winner-loop/).

I'm looking for a role in an organisation that upholds high development standards but encourages individuals to hone their own style and craft.


## Skills

#### Natural Communicator
Open and approachable, friends and colleagues easily trust and confide in me. This lends itself to building strong and cohesive relationships with both clients and colleagues.

##### Product Owner at [The App Business](http://www.theappbusiness.com/)
Working as the proxy between the client and the product team I was able to succeed in the role by:
  - Clearly articulating the product requirements to the team and stakeholders.
  - Taking a diplomatic approach to dealing with clients' changing requirements, protecting the product team whilst keeping stakeholders onside.

##### Digitisation & Outsource Manager at [Metail](http://metail.com/)
Established and maintained clear and consistent communication with our outsource partner in Bangalore, India.

I grew the outsource operation into a repeatable, scalable process resulting in a tenfold increase in operational capacity. Achieved via a combination of:
  - Recruiting and managing a QA team of 3 in the UK.
  - Training, and managing the growth of outsource partner in Bangalore, India.
  - Developing an outsource training programme that successfully reduced rework by 80%.

#### Independent Learner

Seeing the meager three hours of lectures a week in my final year Geography degree I knew that if I wanted to succeed, I'd have a lot of work to do. This mentality has extended through my working life when I made a career shift from an Operations role, to Product Management made possible through a learn-by-doing (and failing!) approach.

##### More recently at 12 week coding bootcamp, [Makers Academy](makersacademy.com)
- The largely hands-off course actively encouraged students to solve their own issues with an issue escalation process starting with Google.
- Prior to, and during the course I put this into practice using more than 10 different coding languages, frameworks and testing suites.
- My work to date is evident throughout my GitHub profile however projects of particular interest may be:

| Project        | Summary          | Technologies used |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| [Salty Daze](https://github.com/heather-camcam/The-app-of-GNAR)      | Rails-AngularJS web app designed to help surfers find the perfect surf spot. Accesses realtime surf-weather stats alongside live webcam and image streams of beaches around the world. Designed and developed in a 2 week sprint for our final project at Makers Academy. | Rails API backend, Instagram API, Google Maps API and Angular front end. Tested with Rspec, Karma and Protractor |
| [My Vaccination Card](https://github.com/heather-camcam/my_vaccination_card)      | A Rails app allowing users to digitally store their vaccination record using data from the World Health Organisation. Designed and developed as part a 2 day hackathon.        |   Rails, tested with Rspec Capybara |


#### Effective Prioritiser

##### Product Owner at The App Business
Never a dull moment, this swiss-army knife role encompassed Client Lead, Project Manager and Product Strategist and took some juggling to succeed in.

Quickly realising that my natural leaning to always say yes is not an effective way of working, I became adept at prioritising and balancing trade offs between:
- Refactoring vs. feature development.
- Team size vs. project length.
- User testing vs. strategic insight.  

##### Final Project at Makers Academy

Two weeks to design, build and pitch a product idea from scratch.

From the start we had our eyes on the MVP, listing out our priority requirements. However, we did not let ourselves be tied down by these and regularly reassessed based on value added and time/complexity to build.

This allowed the team to remain agile throughout and resulted in a polished product and pitch.
